# Cloud Native Suisse Romande - Governance

## The Association

To support the goals of the cloud native computing community in the French-speaking regions of Switzerland,
in 2024 we established a new association which operates under the name _“Cloud Native Suisse Romande”_. 
“Cloud Native Romandy🇨🇭” can be used as an alternative name for communications and materials in English.
The Association is registered on 14.10.2024 in the city of Neuchâtel and operates in accordance with article 60 of the Civil Code of Switzerland.

The association aims to connect end users, contributors, and maintainers of the projects in the cloud native computing (CNC) space, within Suisse Romande (French-speaking regions of Switzerland) and neighboring locations.
