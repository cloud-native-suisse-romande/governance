# Donations

Donations are always appreciated!
  
The association does not have membership fees and, to operate, we use 
voluntary donations from association members and supporters.
Once we have events like [KCD](https://cloud-native-romandy.ch/events/kcd/), 
we will use all profits to support the association and events.

## How to donate

Currently you can make a donation by a direct bank transfer.
In the future, we plan to have a stripe account and GitHub Sponsoors, too.
