> **NOTE:** This charter is a work-in-progress document which is yet to be ratified at the first meeting.
> The meeting is planned on October 31, 2024

## Name and Location

The association operates under the name “Cloud Native Suisse Romande”.
Under paragraph, the Association is registered in the city of Neuchatel and operates in accordance with article 60 of the Civil Code of Switzerland.

## Goal

The association aims to connect end users, contributors, and maintainers of the projects in the cloud native computing (CNC) space, within Suisse Romande (French-speaking regions of Switzerland) and neighboring locations.
These activities include but are not limited to:

* Organizing local meetups, conferences, and other types of events that promote CNC best practices and projects;  
* Promoting local events that are relevant to cloud native computing, and providing the necessary support to the organizers of those events;  
* Supporting the existing or building new local chapters in the cities within the region Suisse Romande;  
* Building distributed communication channels for the CNC community;  
* Maintaining contacts of the local communities with other associations and global organizations like the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF);

The Association is a community-driven entity that does not represent particular companies, vendors, foundations, or other institutions. It intends to operate vendor-neutrally and gives priority to supporting existing community groups instead of creating new entities. 

The Association does not pursue commercial goals, is non-denominational, and does not seek profit.

## Finance

To achieve its objectives, the Association has at its disposal the following means:

* Income from the events organized by the association;  
* Subsidies, donations, and grants of all kinds;  
* Income from contracts for the provision of services, within the scope of the association’s goals and objectives;  
* Voluntary membership fees.

## Language

The association uses both French and English as the official languages for communication and governance.
Based on the high number of expats and English-speaking companies in the region,
we use English as the official governance language.

### Interim Association Council

This temporary entity serves as the Association Council until the Association holds its first elections.

The Association Council elects and changes the Treasurer.
The General Assembly might override this assignment.

## Decision Making

The association intends to make decisions by a consensus of all members and community contributors.
Unless there is a sensitive matter (e.g. Personally-Identifyable Information, Security, Code of Conduct escalation),
key discussions and decisions should happen asynchronously in public communication channels like community Slack, GitHub Issues, or pull requests to respective repositories. 

For substantial decisions, the consensus-based decisions are then ratified by the majority of the Association Council and communicated to the members via email.
nless such a decision is contested within 72 hours, it is considered accepted.
Otherwise, the topic is to be decided at the general assembly meeting.

The decision making process in local chapters and communities might be different.

## Code of Conduct

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. 

The Association operates under a Code of Conduct adapted from Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code\_of\_conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html).
